Code


Audio effects scripts (so for ship thrusters for example, or any audio triggered by anything else)
If time, have a think about game feel for the player ship




Which dialogue could we have?
    (from start of game) Start instance 1 (Specify controls) + (timer from previous dialogue section) Prompt user out of game window to look somewhere else
    (from start of game) Start instance 2
    (Collide ships) Finish game
    (from GameLoader) Finish game from other instance
    (from start of game) Start superfluous instance


5. make sure dialogue doesn't overrun itself (specifically the long cutscene from instance1) (I think this is done now)
6. change ship colours?










Config

Need some music sources
The positioning of the environment parts
    If these are trees, there may be some setup required

Set up some colliders on the player and environment?
